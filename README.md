# mdn-community

We put people first and do our best to recognize, appreciate and respect the diversity of our global contributors. The MDN Web Docs project welcomes contributions from everyone who shares our goals and wants to contribute in a healthy and constructive manner within our community.

MDN community is the repository where you will find the [offical MDN Web Docs public feedback discussions](https://github.com/mdn/mdn-community/discussions).

## Participation guideline highlights

To ensure we maintain a healthy, friendly, and welcoming community, we want to highlight the behaviours we expect from our community.

### Expected behaviours

* **Being respectful**
    * Value each other’s ideas, styles, and viewpoints. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. 
* **Being direct but professional**
    * We must be able to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve. We need to be honest and direct, as well as respectful.
* **Being inclusive**
    * Seek diverse perspectives. Diversity of views and of people on teams powers innovation, even if it is not always comfortable. Encourage all voices.
* **Understanding different perspectives**
    * Our goal should not be to “win” every disagreement or argument. A more productive goal is to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better.
* **Appreciating and accommodating our similarities and differences**
    * Be respectful of people with different cultural practices, attitudes, and beliefs. Work to eliminate your own biases, prejudices, and discriminatory practices. Think of others’ needs from their point of view.
* **Leading by example**
    * Design your community and your work for inclusion. Hold yourself and others accountable for inclusive behaviours. Make decisions based on the highest good.

As important as knowing what you **should** is to know what **not** to do.

### Unacceptable behaviours

* **Violence and threats of violence**
    * Violence and threats of violence are not acceptable - online or offline.
* **Personal Attacks**
    * Conflicts will inevitably arise, but frustration should never turn into a personal attack. It is not okay to insult, demean or belittle others.
* **Derogatory Language**
    * If you’re unsure if a word is derogatory, don’t use it. This also includes repeated subtle and/or indirect discrimination; when asked to stop, stop the behaviour in question.
* **Unwelcome Sexual Attention or Physical Contact**
    * This includes sexualised comments, jokes or imagery in interactions, communications or presentation materials, as well as inappropriate touching, groping, or sexual advances.
* **Disruptive Behaviour**
    * Sustained disruption of events, forums, or meetings, including talks and presentations, will not be tolerated.
