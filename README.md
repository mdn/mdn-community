## Participation guideline highlights

To ensure we maintain a healthy, friendly, and welcoming community, we want to highlight the behaviours we expect from our community.

### Expected behaviours

* **Being respectful**
    * Value each other’s ideas, styles, and viewpoints. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. 
* **Being direct but professional**
    * We must be able to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve. We need to be honest and direct, as well as respectful.
* **Being inclusive**
    * Seek diverse perspectives. Diversity of views and of people on teams powers innovation, even if it is not always comfortable. Encourage all voices.
* **Understanding different perspectives**
    * Our goal should not be to “win” every disagreement or argument. A more productive goal is to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better.
* **Appreciating and accommodating our similarities and differences**
    * Be respectful of people with different cultural practices, attitudes, and beliefs. Work to eliminate your own biases, prejudices, and discriminatory practices. Think of others’ needs from their point of view.
* **Leading by example**
    * Design your community and your work for inclusion. Hold yourself and others accountable for inclusive behaviours. Make decisions based on the highest good.

As important as knowing how you **should** conduct yourself is understanding unacceptable conduct.

### Unacceptable behaviours

* **Violence and threats of violence**
    * Violence and threats of violence are not acceptable - online or offline.
* **Personal attacks**
    * Conflicts will inevitably arise, but frustration should never turn into a personal attack. It is not okay to insult, demean, or belittle others.
* **Derogatory language**
    * If you’re unsure if a word is derogatory, don’t use it. This also includes repeated subtle and/or indirect discrimination; when asked to stop, stop the behaviour in question.
* **Unwelcome sexual attention or physical contact**
    * This includes sexualised comments, jokes or imagery in interactions, communications, or presentation materials, as well as inappropriate touching, groping, or sexual advances.
* **Disruptive behaviour**
    * Sustained disruption of events, forums, or meetings, including talks and presentations, will not be tolerated.
